[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/badge/pub-1.2.0-blue)](https://pub.dev/packages/imageview360)

Add the Package
```yaml
dependencies:
  imageview360: ^1.2.0
```
## How to use

Import the package in your dart file

```dart
import 'package:imageview360/imageview360.dart';

```

##### Basic usage :

```dart
ImageView360(
     key: UniqueKey(),
     imageList: imageList,
),
```

Note: For ImageView360 to show instant changes on hot reload, you need to provide `UniqueKey()` so that the widget rebuilds every time.

##### Customisable usage :
```dart
ImageView360(
    key: UniqueKey(),                                           
    imageList: imageList,                                       
    autoRotate: true,                                           //Optional
    rotationCount: 2,                                           //Optional
    rotationDirection: RotationDirection.anticlockwise,         //Optional
    frameChangeDuration: Duration(milliseconds: 50),            //Optional
    swipeSensitivity: 2,                                        //Optional
    allowSwipeToRotate: true,                                   //Optional
    onImageIndexChanged: (currentImageIndex) {                  //Optional
                          print("currentImageIndex: $currentImageIndex");
                        },
)
```
Note: For better experience always precache image before providing the images to the widget as follows.

##### Example for loading and precaching images from assets :

```dart
 List<ImageProvider> imageList = List<ImageProvider>();
   for (int i = 1; i <= 52; i++) {
      imageList.add(AssetImage('assets/sample/$i.png'));
// To precache images so that when required they are loaded faster.
      await precacheImage(AssetImage('assets/sample/$i.png'), context);
    }
```
